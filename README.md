# Movie_Recommender

# [Project: Recommender Systems](https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/week_10_project)

* Built a web application that showcases movie recommendations using the small version of the MovieLens-dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
* Performed data engineering on missing data(KNN Imputer, Mean Movie Ratings).
* Implemented the following models trying to find the lowest Mean Error :
	- Simple recommender based on correlations
	- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization model
	- KMeans (clustering)
	- Nearest Neighbour
* Wrote a flask web interface and connected the recommender-model to flask
